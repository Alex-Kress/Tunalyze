# Tunalyze

*Tunalyze is an app that allows a user to input song lyrics to determine what song they came from and who the artist is.  The user can then also search by artist name to determine the genre of the artist.  Additionally, the apps stores the user's searchs in a library that allows the user to return to the app later and see what they have been listening to recently, to help them determine what they want to listen to at that particular moment, on YouTube or other music sites and apps.  The app is mainly intended for users who prefer the free version of Youtube as their music app of choice.*

## Project Description

This website was created with an HTML document that was linked to the CSS Framework Bulma.  Some additional CSS was added through a separate CSS document.  The functionality of the site was created with Javascript using Fetch requests from the APIs Musixmatch and The AudioDB.

The website contains a custom-created logo of "Tina the Tuna", a header with an input bar where users can type in the song lyrics or name of the artist they want to search, a main section with a box that populates with the search results, and another box that functions as a library with local storage to store the user's recent searches, and a footer with a link the an existing 3rd party game called "Heardle" and a non-profit that is dedicated to sustainable fishing practices with Tuna.
